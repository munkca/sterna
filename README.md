# sterna
30-key hot-swap wireless keyboard based on the Tern.

This is my remodeled and personalized [Tern](https://github.com/rschenk/tern/)/[tern-ble](https://gitlab.com/gleb_sexy/tern-ble/) adapted to my personal preferences. I used this adaptation as a means to get familiar with Ergogen and kiCAD.

Differences from the Tern/Tern-ble:
- choc-spacing (17.5 x 16.5 mm)
- more splay and stagger
- wireless
- on/off switch
- reset button
- bottom case with acrylic keyplate

## Warning
This is an untested work in progress. I will let you know once I have built and tested this keyboard.
